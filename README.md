__Youssef Land Chat__ is a React app that only works with Node.js.
## Set up Youssef Land Chat
You'll need the latest version of Node.js and any version of Git that supports HTTP cloning for this. Are you ready? Let's get started!

Follow these steps (command line is recommended):

1. Type `https://github.com/yoyomonem/Youssef-Land.Chat.git` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>;
2. Type `cd Youssef-Land.Chat` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>;
3. Type `npm start` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>;
4. Go to `https://localhost:3000` (npm automatically does that after using `npm start` because of the `package.json` included with this repo), and you're done!
